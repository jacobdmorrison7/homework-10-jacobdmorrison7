## Homework 10

For this homework, your job is simple: create a PyQt application on the Pi Zero to turn an LED on and off and to indicate when a button is pressed. The GUI can be a simple two-widget layout with a button (for turning the led on and off) and a text or other indicator that shows when the button is pressed (or, in our case, the wires are shorted).

Your code should use the same pin assignments as I used in class (and the videos).

In lieu of a formal GitHub repository, which you are free to make and submit here on your own, I ask that you (1) either show me the working code in class or (2) upload a <30-second video here to Canvas with a link to your GitHub repository.  Yeah, you see what I'm trying to do here, right?
